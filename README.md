# Farkle_Flip_Card
Farkle is a basic points-based game that uses dice to score. However, in Farkle Flip the cards represent one side of a die (1 thorough 6). The player collects combinations of cards and these combinations are worth points. As with the original Farkle, the objective of Farkle Flip is to be the first player to score 3000 points. Players start with one card each, and they take turns drawing from the deck to try to score points using number combinations. Banking player points will add them to their score total. However, players need to be careful because drawing a Farkle card can end their turn and result in a loss of points in that round. (1)
